To construct the widiv pan genome, all genotype reads were mapped to B73v5 reference genome. PE reads with at least one end not mapped were extracted to perform de novo assembly using k-mer size of 53. All assembed contigs for all genotypes were jointed and compressed using sequence ideneity of 95%. Blasting to UniRef allowed us to remove contamiants sequences. Repeat masking was performed prior the contig annotation. All contigs with gene models were jointed together as the pan-contigs (23k contigs)
